main.dart  --> this is where our code starts, 
there you can see it returns AUthpage() (which is a function in the file called authpage.dart 
in the folder 'pages'(lib--pages--authpage.dart)!)

authpage.dart --> this is where i connected firebase, like if they logged there it should lead us to
homepage(lib--pages--home_page.dart) but yeah unfortunately this thing doesnt work.

login.dart--> this contains neccessary ui design for the login page, backed by the folders components and images 
for icons and repeated functions.
